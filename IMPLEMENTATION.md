  - Corrected grid layout from `md:grid-cols-1` to proper responsive columns
  - Removed dark background (`bg-[#000000]`) for better UX
  - Fixed duplicate `loadData()` call in useEffect
- **Improvements**:
  - Implemented responsive grid: 1 column (mobile) → 2 columns (tablet) → 3 columns (desktop) → 4 columns (large screens)

  - Smooth color transitions between transparent and solid states

### ✅ 3. Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: 
  - Priority loading for above-the-fold images (first 8 cards)
  - Optimized image sizes with `sizes` prop for different viewports
  - Lazy loading for non-critical components
- **Memoization**:
  - `useMemo` for expensive filtering and sorting operations
  - `useCallback` for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - `React.memo` for worker cards to avoid re-rendering unchanged items
- **Skeleton Loading**: 
  - Custom skeleton screens during data loading
  - Smooth loading animations with CSS keyframes
  - Better perceived performance

### ✅ 4. Pagination System
- **Features**:
  - Smart pagination with ellipsis for large page counts
  - Configurable items per page (12 workers per page)
  - Smooth scroll to top on page change
  - Previous/Next navigation with disabled states
  - Dynamic page number display with proper spacing

### ✅ 5. Advanced Service Filters
- **Filter Types**:
  - Service type dropdown (All Services + individual services)
  - Price range inputs with min/max validation
  - Sort options: Name (A-Z), Price (Low to High), Price (High to Low)
- **Features**:
  - Real-time filtering with immediate results
  - Automatic pagination reset on filter changes
  - Reset filters functionality
  - Filters work seamlessly with pagination
  - Price filters include tax calculation (GST 18%)

### ✅ 6. Bug Fixes & Code Quality
- **Fixed Bugs**:
  - Removed duplicate API call in useEffect
  - Fixed responsive grid issues
  - Improved color contrast and accessibility
  - Fixed console warnings and errors
- **Code Improvements**:
  - TypeScript strict mode compliance
  - Component-driven architecture
  - Clean, readable, and maintainable code
  - Proper error handling and edge cases

### ✅ 7. Complete API Integration
- **API Implementation**:
  - Custom React hook (`useWorkers`) for data fetching
  - RESTful API endpoint `/api/workers` serving JSON data
  - Loading states with skeleton screens
  - Comprehensive error handling with retry functionality
  - Client-side caching (5-minute cache duration)
- **Features**:
  - Graceful error boundaries with user-friendly error messages
  - Loading indicators during API calls
  - Retry mechanism for failed requests
  - Data validation and filtering
  - Legacy code properly commented out (not deleted)

## 🛠 Technical Implementation
